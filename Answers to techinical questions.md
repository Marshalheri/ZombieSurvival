1. I spent about 6 hours actively working on this application

2. I will add the following:
- Add the frontend to consume the APIs i have built.
- Add ability for admin management to manage users backend.
- Add functionalities for price management from the admin.

3. To track down performance issues on production, i will do the following:
- Index database table columns i frequently use for querrying the database.
- Cache data that are not frequently changing and then update them either through some user induced actions where necessary or by the use of some background task.
- Ensure that my journey to request from third-party systems are optimized even though i don't have power over the behavior of the system i am calling.

4. To improve the APIs i will do the below:
- Work more on the action that handles trading to ensure that buyer and seller resources are properly regulated accross board.
